The Mumble team is proud to announce the first beta of Mumble 1.2.4.
  
This is a big step towards the next stable release in the 1.2 series.

Now is a good time to try the [new][1] and old features and report back to us about any issues you can find.

You can get the 1.2.4 beta from our page at [mumble.info][2].

We would also like to encourage you again to [translate Mumble][3] to your native language.
