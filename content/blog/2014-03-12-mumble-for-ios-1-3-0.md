The Mumble team has released [version 1.3.0 of the iOS Mumble client][1].

This new version contains a fix for the [iOS 7.1 issue we recently blogged about][2]. It is also the first release to use the iOS 7 look and feel.

As always, it’s available on the [App Store][1]. And don’t forget — if you enjoy the app, please spread the word, and remember to rate it in the App Store.
