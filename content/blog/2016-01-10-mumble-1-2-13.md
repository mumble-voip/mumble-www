<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-232" title="Mumblesoftwarelogo" src="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/w/logo.png" alt="" />The Mumble team has [released version 1.2.13][1] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.13 is a security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

<!--more-->

Mumble 1.2.13 fixes a security-relevant bug in Murmur when running on Windows systems that allowed an unauthenticated user to cause Denial of Service on the server&#8217;s UDP connection. See [Mumble-SA-2016-001][2] ([sig][3]).

We would like to thank [LuaMilkshake][4] for responsibly reporting this issue to the Mumble project.

This release of Mumble on Windows is also the first stable release in the 1.2-series that is only code-signed with a SHA256 authenticode signature and certificate. Previous releases were signed by both a SHA1 signature and certificate, as well as a SHA256 signature and certificate.

This new code-signing setup can cause issues with some versions of Windows that do not support SHA256 code-signing. If your Mumble installer on Windows does not seem to be Authenticode signed, it probably means that your version of Windows does not support SHA256 code-signing. In that case, we recommend that you ensure the integrity of your Mumble installer by verifying the detached GPG signature (mumble-1.2.13.msi.sig) against our ["Mumble Automatic Build Infrastructure 2016" GPG key][5].

Issues fixes in this release include:

  * In previous versions of Mumble, it was possible to perform a Denial of Service attack on Murmur servers running on Windows. See [Mumble-SA-2016-001][2] ([sig][3]) for more information. 

For a full changelog, please see [the diff between 1.2.12 and 1.2.13 on GitHub][6].

We recommend that all users of Murmur (the server component of Mumble) on Windows upgrade immediately.

You can download this release on [GitHub][7]. Enjoy!
