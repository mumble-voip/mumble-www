<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-232" title="Mumblesoftwarelogo" src="http://mumble.sourceforge.net/w/logo.png" alt="" />The Mumble team has [released version 1.2.11][1] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.11 is a bugfix and security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

<!--more-->

For our binary releases, this release updates OpenSSL to 1.0.1q. Please see OpenSSL&#8217;s security advisory on the 1.0.1q release for more information: <https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20151203.txt>

Furthermore, we have also updated various other libraries in our binary releases to patch security vulnerabilities in those. For more information, we recommend you check out the [mumble-releng repository on GitHub][2].

Bug fixes in this release include:

  * Fixed a bug where Mumble global shortcuts on X11 would not release properly when Chrome/Chromium was the frontmost application.
  * Improved the help text for allowing keyboard keys to be used for global shortcuts on OS X Mavericks and above.
  * Fixed a bug where clients would automatically reconnect after being kicked.
  * Inserting an image in the chat should now always cause Mumble to scroll correctly to the bottom of the log.
  * Opening mumble:// URLs should now correctly allow people to change channels if a URL is opened while Mumble is running.
  * Fixed an issue where the &#8220;shortcut/linux/evdev/enable&#8221; config option was not saved correctly, and overwritten when closing Mumble.

For a full changelog, please see [the diff between 1.2.10 and 1.2.11 on GitHub][3].

We recommend all users upgrade immediately.

You can download this release on [GitHub][4]. Enjoy!
