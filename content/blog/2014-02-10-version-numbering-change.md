Mumble&#8217;s version numbers have been a great source of confusion for a long time. Version 1.1.8 being incompatible with 1.2.0, only incrementing the last place of the version number even though big changes were made and so on. This will change.

**TL;DR:** The next version will be 1.3.0 not 1.2.6. The next feature release after that 1.4.0 and so on.

<!--more-->In practice we used &#8220;

_1.<major>.<minor>_&#8221; in which theÂ _major_ number is incremented for breaking changes and the _minor_ number for feature releases. This wasn&#8217;t actually intended but we were never quite happy with the amount and kind of features we added to actually name a release Mumble 2. Even with the massive and backwards compatibility breaking changes introduced in {{< wiki "1.2.0" />}}.

We do realize this is kinda ridiculous so for future releases we will switch to a &#8220;_<major>.<minor>.<patch>_&#8221; numbering schema. _Major_ and _minor_ have the same meaning as above while _patch_ is used only for security and bugfix releases like {{< wiki "1.2.5" />}}.

This means that the next feature release of Mumble will be {{< wiki "1.3.0" />}} and still will be fully compatible with 1.2.X clients and servers. The next backwards compatibility breaking changes will be in Mumble 2 but there will likely be multiple feature releases before we will feel the need to take that step.

Regards,

The Mumble team
