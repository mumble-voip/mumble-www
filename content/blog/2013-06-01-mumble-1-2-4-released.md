The Mumble team is proud to announce the release of version 1.2.4 of the Mumble VoIP application.

With this new version we are introducing the revolutionary [Opus][1] [audio codec][2], Windows 8 support and many other improvements over our last stable release (see the {{< wiki "1.2.4" "Mumble 1.2.4" />}} wiki page for more information). Opus is now the primary audio codec of choice for Mumble.

We are also happy to see our positional audio technology seeing wider adoption in the gaming world with Valve including support in many of their source engine games. Namely Team Fortress 2, Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source on all supported platforms including Linux and Mac OS X.

Positional audio allows you to hear your teammates from the position they are in-game without any changes to your Mumble server. On any game server. For more information about how it works and how to activate it visit our {{< wiki "Positional-Audio" "Positional audio" />}} wiki page.

Positional audio information can be used by the Mumble server to even greater effect. To show the power of this technology we have also released a Source engine game-specific plugin for the mumo server-side scripting framework for Mumble. To find out more about that visit the {{< wiki Mumo_source "Mumo Source plugin" />}} wiki page.

As always you can find the new release on our web site at <http://www.mumble.info> . If you have any questions or comments visit our [forums][6] or join our IRC channel #mumble on freenode.org .
