Our infrastructure is made possible thanks to the help of the following sponsors:

## Fastly

Thanks to [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com)’s CDN, only ~5% of the traffic hits our servers. The rest of the traffic is served by their insanely fast network.

This service provides us quite a few important advantages, such as:

* Caching. This allowed our websites to be reachable during server(s) maintenance.
* High speed. Very important, especially for our download server.
* Lower bandwidth costs (our servers are not sponsored).
* IPv6 support, even for IPv4-only backends.
* DDoS protection.

Also, we haven’t experienced a single downtime in many years.

## MacStadium

Thanks to [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com) we can maintain support for macOS, as they provide us access to a 2012 Mac Mini.

Before that, the only member of our team who owns a Mac used to do all the macOS-related work, until he unfortunately had no time to dedicate to the project anymore.

We’re very happy with the service so far. *Slightly* less happy with macOS, but that’s another story (and unrelated to the service itself).

## 1Password

Our experience with 1Password began years ago, when looking for a versatile way to share credentials with the team.

A team member had already been using their service for a while, so we decided to give it a try.

Fast forward to today and we can say for sure that we couldn't be happier.

* The web interface is great. Navigating between multiple vaults and managing the organization is intuitive.
* The password generator is excellent, it outputs passwords that can be easily typed.
* No trackers. This is very important, especially when dealing with credentials.
* 2FA is supported, allowing us to use it for shared accounts.

They are now offering us their service for free! For reference: https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source/pull/243
