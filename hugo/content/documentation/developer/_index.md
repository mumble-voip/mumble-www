A lot of the developer documentation can be found in the
[Mumble repository docs subfolder](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/tree/master/docs) as Markdown text documents.

This includes some client documentation, but in [docs/dev](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/tree/master/docs/dev)
more technical documentation like
[build instructions](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/tree/master/docs/dev/build-instructions), source code,
feature and concept documentation, and development workflow guidance.

Apart from that documentation, referred to and linked above, this website hosts the following documentation and
documentation categories.
