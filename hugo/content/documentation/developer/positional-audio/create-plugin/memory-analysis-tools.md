title: "Memory Analysis Tools"
---
Warning: Be aware that most of these are tools used to create and execute hacks and might trigger anti cheat protection.
Note that Mumble does NOT support cheating of any kind. We use these utilities because the interface is easy to use and they fit our purposes; they are simply memory searching tools, required to find the positional addresses in the game.

## Windows

* [Cheat Engine](http://www.cheatengine.org): Very comfortable, easy to use program to gather addresses. It has everything you need, and more!
* [UsaMimi Hurricane](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA028184/english/index.html): No description
* [ArtMoney](http://www.artmoney.ru): No description

## Linux

* [Cheat Engine server](http://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php): This server allows you to scan a Linux process through the network using Cheat Engine on Windows. If you don't have a Windows machine, you can use Wine to run Cheat Engine and connect to the server on Linux.
* [GameConqueror/scanmem](https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem): It's basically the Linux counterpart of Cheat Engine.
* [PINCE](https://github.com/korcankaraokcu/PINCE): It has more advanced features than GameConqueror, but it doesn't scan memory addresses yet.
