title: "Mumble Overlay on macOS"
---

The Mumble in-game Overlay allows you to see who is talking, the game's FPS, and the current time within videogames.

Mumble installs on macOS without administrative rights. But the Overlay requires administrative rights to be able to
show up within games. Consequently, an additional setup step is necessary.

To install the Mumble Overlay:

1. Launch Mumble
2. Open the Settings window and open the Overlay section
3. Install the overlay from here
