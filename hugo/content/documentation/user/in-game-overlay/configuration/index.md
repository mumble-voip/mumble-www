The Mumble settings have an Overlay category which allows you to configure how and what the overlay displays as well as
in what applications it displays.

## Configuring in what applications it displays

The _Overlay Exceptions_ define in what applications the overlay will display.

| Mode                | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Launcher Filter     | Supports launchers where child processes will show an overlay (e.g. Steam, Origin, etc. launch a game)                                                           |
| Whitelist           | Overlay is disabled by default. The specified applications will show the overlay.                                                                                |
| Blacklist           | Overlay is enabled by default (for any applications using rendering). The specified applications will not show the overlay.                                      |
| `nooverlay` file    | If a file named `nooverlay` (no file extension) is placed next to an application executable, the overlay will not show.                                          |
| `debugoverlay` file | If a file named `debugoverlay` (no file extension) is placed next to an application executable, the more debug information messages are logged to the debug log. |
