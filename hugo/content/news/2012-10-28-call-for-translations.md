Hi,

Mumble version 1.2.4 is now feature complete. Accordingly we have entered string freeze before the upcoming release. This means there will be no new text added or replaced before the release.<!--more-->

Our translation guide can be found at {{< wiki "Language Translation" />}}.

There is also a new guide for creating Windows installer translations you

might want to take a look at. You can find it in our wiki at {{< wiki "Windows installers translations" />}}.

We are looking forward to your translations, updates and fixes.

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to send them to the translators mailing list or hit us up on IRC in #mumble on freenode.

Regards,

The Mumble team
