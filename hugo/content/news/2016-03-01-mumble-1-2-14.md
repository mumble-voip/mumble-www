The Mumble team has [released version 1.2.14][1] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.14 is a bugfix release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

<!--more-->

The actual source changes in 1.2.14 are small. This release removes a [commit][2] that caused crashing issues on exit for some users of our overlay feature. This commit was backported from the 1.3.x (master) branch in order to fix a hang issue some people are seeing with the overlay, but the change was not ready for prime time.

The previous release of Mumble, 1.2.13, transitioned to only signing Windows releases of Mumble with our SHA256 Authenticode certificate. As explained in the blog post for 1.2.13, we went from a scenario where we signed Mumble with both a SHA1 signature and certificate, as well as a SHA256 signature and certificate. We did this because of Microsoft&#8217;s SHA1 deprecation in code signing. This change has caused several issues for Windows Vista users, and we&#8217;ve refined the process. The Mumble 1.2.14 release is now signed with a SHA1 signature and SHA256 certificate, as well as a SHA256 signature and SHA256 certificate. This makes it easier for legacy versions of Windows to verify the signature of Mumble.

For a full changelog, please see [the diff between 1.2.13 and 1.2.14 on GitHub][3].
