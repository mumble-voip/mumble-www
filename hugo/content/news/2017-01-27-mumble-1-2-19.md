The Mumble team has [released version 1.2.19][1] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.19 is a bugfix and security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

This version of Mumble fixes a problem where the output of Murmur&#8217;s -limits command was never shown. It also updates the OpenSSL version that our binary packages are built against to 1.0.2k.

Changes in this release:

* OpenSSL in our binary packages have been updated to 1.0.2k due to <a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170126.txt" title="OpenSSL Security Advisory [26 Jan 2017]" target="_blank">OpenSSL Security Advisory [26 Jan 2017]</a>
* Murmur&#8217;s -limits command will now print output as it runs, instead of at exit. (<a href="https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/commit/98cd156f0c26be2bacc22d8c64db9c349f16a213" target="_blank">98cd156f0c26be2bacc22d8c64db9c349f16a213</a>) </ul>
