The Mumble team has released version 1.2.7 of the Mumble VoIP application. This is a minor bug fix release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.<!--more-->

This release contains a couple of bug fixes to the Mumble client and updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.0m due to an OpenSSL security advisory. We advise our users to download this update as soon as possible from our SourceForge downloads page: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/Mumble/1.2.7/>

If you are using one our packaged static Murmur servers, or Murmur on Windows, or any of our packaged Mumble client packages we advise you to update to get the OpenSSL security fixes. If you are using Mumble or Murmur from your distro, you do not need to update, but make sure your OpenSSL library has received an update for the security issues.

Changes in this release:

* The log view in Mumble 1.2.6 didn&#8217;t correctly scroll when an image is included in a text message. ([Issue #1258][1])
* Some users were unable to connect to Mumble servers due to a &#8220;remote host closed the connection&#8221; caused by a bug in Skype&#8217;s optional click-to-call feature ([Issue #1271][2])
* OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.0m due to [OpenSSL Security Advisory [05 Jun 2014]][3]
