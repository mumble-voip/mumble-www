Mumble&#8217;s future primary codec Opus is now an official IETF standard ([RFC 6716][1]) and its reference implementations officially released. This is very good news for the Web as well as Mumble. If you want to figure out more about this new codec take a look at the announcements of [Mozilla][2] and the [Xiph.Org Foundation][3] .
