The Mumble team has released version 1.2.8 of the Mumble VoIP application. This is a minor bug fix release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.<!--more-->

This release contains a couple of bug fixes to the Mumble client and updates OpenSSL to version 1.0.0n due to an OpenSSL security advisory. We advise our users to download this update as soon as possible from our SourceForge downloads page: <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/Mumble/1.2.8/>

If you are using one our packaged static Murmur servers, or Murmur on Windows, or any of our packaged Mumble client packages we advise you to update to get the OpenSSL security fixes. If you are using Mumble or Murmur from your distro, you do not need to update, but make sure your OpenSSL library has received an update for the security issues.

Changes in this release:

* OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.0n due to [OpenSSL Security Advisory [06 August 2014]][1]
* A PulseAudio issue that could cause the Mumble client to crash on launch has been fixed.
* Various source-level issues that made the Mumble build fail when built with Clang has been fixed.
* The Windows installer, as well as all .EXE and .DLL files are now code-signed with an Authenticode signature that uses a SHA256 digest in addition to the previous SHA1-based signature.
* The Windows build is now built using the buildenv/1.2.x/win32 build environment from mumble-releng.
* For a source-level changelog, please see [the GitHub commit list][2] or the [CHANGES file][3] for Mumble 1.2.8.

All of these changes are already available in our snapshot builds, so if you like living on the bleeding edge and want to help out with Mumble development, feel free to check out our development snapshots at [http://mumble.info/.][4]
