Today we&#8217;re releasing version 1.1 of the Mumble iOS app on the App Store.

This release addresses quite a few of the most sought-after features missing from the 1.0 version, along with fixes for various crashes and memory leaks.

<!--more-->

## **New Features**

* An improved icon for the app. Thanks Karsten Bruns!
* Searchable public server list. Thanks Jimmy Selgen Nielsen!
* Bluetooth headset support.
* Echo Cancellation support for the built-in mic.
* Improved Push-to-Talk configurability and discoverability.
* Self-registration is now supported.
* Intermediate certificates can now, optionally, be shown in the Certificate Preferences. Intermediate certificates are colored green. Identities keep their yellow color.
* When exporting a certificate for which a chain can be built, the whole chain will be exported.
* Improved crash reporting. After a crash, the app will allow you to submit a crash report directly to the Mumble Developers. An &#8216;Always&#8217; option is also available, and we hope users will make use of this feature.

## **Bug Fixes**

* Various crash bugs have been fixed.
* Various memory leaks have been plugged. Thanks Jimmy Selgen Nielsen!
* The 1.0 version of the app failed to parse some Distinguished Names from X.509 certificates. A more solid DN parser has been implemented.
* When connecting to a server, the client will now attempt to build up a full certificate chain using certificates found in the app&#8217;s keychain.
* Importing a PKCS #12 file now correctly imports an identity (certificate and private key), along with all intermediate certificates.
* All action sheets in the app have been converted to black to better fit in with the rest of the app.
* Transitioning between the Channel view and a modal view, such as Access Tokens, now provides a better visual experience.
* The mumble.sqlite database is no longer a hidden file in ~/Documents. It now lives in ~/Library.
* The public server list file is no longer a hidden file in ~/Documents. It now lives in ~/Library.
