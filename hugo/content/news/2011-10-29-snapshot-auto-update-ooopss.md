We noticed a medium sized ooops in Mumble today. It seems that in February this year a regression slipped in that broke automatic update checks for snapshot builds. The regression is now fixed.

We recommend all snapshot users to update to the new version by manually triggering an update check via &#8220;Help->Check for Update&#8221;.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
