As you might have already noticed we changed the hosting for our wiki as well as the forums. Especially if our previous forums hosted at SourceForge gave you trouble or the slow loading when editing the wiki made you sad this is the time to take another look.

You can find the **forums** on <https://forums.mumble.info>. The **wiki** as usual can be reached via <https://www.mumble.info>.

While old wiki URLs will keep working and are redirected to the new one we recommend updating any links/bookmarks you might have to prevent any breakage in the future. The contents of the old phpBB SF forums were transferred to the new one. If you had an account on these forums you can use password recovery to re-claim your account. Make sure to pay attention to the instructions mentioned on the recovery page. This content and account transfer wasn&#8217;t possible for the basic SF discussion forums. We decided to turn those read-only to keep the information they contain accessible.

While we were at it we gave the forum a new look and thanks to a generous open source sponsorship by [fastly.com][1] forum as well as the wiki are now behind a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network" target="_blank">CDN</a> and should feel snappy like never before.

We hope you like these changes and are looking forward to seeing you in the forums.

The Mumble Team
