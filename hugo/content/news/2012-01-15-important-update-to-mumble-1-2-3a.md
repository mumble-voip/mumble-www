Due to an expiring certificate no Mumble 1.2.2 or newer released before today (15.01.2012) will work on the Windows Platform after 15 January 2012 11:36:47 GMT. If such an outdated Mumble is launched after that date the error message &#8220;A referral was returned by the server&#8221; will be displayed by Windows and Mumble will not start.

**You can get fixed installers from [from our project page][1].**
