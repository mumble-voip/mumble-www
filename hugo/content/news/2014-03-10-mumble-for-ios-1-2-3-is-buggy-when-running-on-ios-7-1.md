A word of warning: &#8216;Mumble for iOS&#8217; 1.2.3 is incredibly unusable on iOS 7.1 &#8211; if you depend on it, you should probably not update to iOS 7.1 just yet.

There is a problem with audio subsystem, which is causing it to endlessly try to restart itself. This manifests itself via iOS&#8217;s &#8216;red bar&#8217; (signalling that an app is using background audio) toggling itself on and off very fast (even when inside the app!), making the app unusable.

We&#8217;ve identified the problem, and we&#8217;re working on a fix. If you&#8217;ve already updated to iOS 7.1, fear not! We&#8217;ve also found a workaround which, while inconvenient, should help you work around the issue until a proper fix has been released.

To work around the issue, you disable Echo Cancellation in the app. Here&#8217;s how:

* In Mumble&#8217;s Preferences, navigate to &#8216;Advanced&#8217; under Audio.
* When in there, look for the &#8216;Audio Input&#8217; section.
* There should be a checkbox for Echo Cancellation. Disable it.

It can be hard when the bug is occurring. If you&#8217;re having trouble, swipe/drag the checkbox&#8217;s button to disable it.

* Double tap your home button.
* Swipe upwards on the Mumble app to close it.
* Re-open Mumble. The issue should be gone.
* If the issue is still present, navigate to &#8216;Echo Cancellation&#8217; again, and check that it&#8217;s really disabled. It might not work the first time, due to the &#8216;red bar&#8217; making it very hard to actually execute these steps.

We hope it works for you!

Furthermore, we&#8217;d like to note that we hope to be able to submit an updated app with this issue fixed tonight.﻿ This update will also bring some other goodies, so stay tuned.
