One important milestone for any Mumble release is freezing the text-strings. After a freeze, no changes are allowed, which means our translators can start working. For this release, we&#8217;d like a bit of help proofing and checking the strings before we freeze them.

<!--more-->The usual method for freezing strings is to export them all to a webpage, load that webpage into Word and use the spelling and grammar checker. This catches the worst mistakes, and there always are quite a few. However, it does not catch nuances of language, and it certainly doesn&#8217;t catch wrong information.

As I was looking through the strings for this release, I notice that the tooltip for the bitrate in the audiostats mention that you can adjust the bitrate by changing complexity in the audio settings. We replaced the complexity slider with a direct bitrate slider before 1.2.0, so that text has been wrong for quite a few releases. Thankfully, it appears nobody has noticed.

Translations are one of the last hurdles before 1.2.3 ships, and since translations can&#8217;t start until strings are frozen, we need a bit of help. The dev team wrote these strings, and we&#8217;ve seen them so many times we aren&#8217;t really reading them anymore. It&#8217;s therefore hard for us to spot mistakes and errors.

So, if you find any spelling, grammar or textual logic errors in the current snapshot, or in the [exported strings][2], please let us know ðŸ™‚

**UPDATE:** Strings are frozen now. Thanks for your help.
