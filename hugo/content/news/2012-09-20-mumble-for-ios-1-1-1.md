 We&#8217;ve released an emergency iOS 6 bug fix for the Mumble iOS client today — Mumble for iOS 1.1.1.

It works around a compatibility issue with iOS 6 that caused users to be silent when transmitting audio. A few other crash bugs have also been fixed in the 1.1.1 release.<!--more-->

Along with that, the new version of the app uses the latest version of MumbleKit.

As always, it&#8217;s available on the [App Store][1]. And don’t forget — if you enjoy the app, please spread the word, and remember to rate it in the App Store.
