We have finally finished integrating <a href="https://www.transifex.com/" target="_blank">Transifex </a>into our workflow. Transifex is an online translation tool which allows collaborative translation of applications directly from a browser.

For Mumble this means that it is now easier than ever before to contribute translations for your language to the project. Simply visit our <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/mumble/" target="_blank">Transifex project page</a>, sign up and get started. For a step by step guide see {{< wiki "Language Translation" "this page in our wiki" />}}.

<!--more-->The direct integration into our workflow also means your translations will be integrated into Mumble snapshots in a timely manner. Translations changes will be pulled in once per day. We will still do a quick review before they actually hit the Snapshots but as the work we have to do for accepting changes is now reduced to literally two mouse-clicks you can expect to see your work without much more delay.
