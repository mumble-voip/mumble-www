## Report Bugs

We track bugs, tasks and feature requests as [**_issues_ on GitHub**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues).

If you find a bug, please **check if an issue ticket already exists** for it. If you find an existing issue ticket

- Provide additional information if you think any is missing (especially for reproducibility or environment conditions)
- Thumbs-up (üëç) the ticket itself to indicate you experienced the issue too
- Sometimes we ask for testers for a potential fix _(see also our
  [`test-needed` ticket label](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/labels/needs-testing))_
- You can follow it for update notifications

If you **can not find a ticket** for your issue, please **create one**. Provide any context, expected and actual
behavior, and environment information that can help us understand, reproduce, and fix the issue.

**Note:** For bugs that cause security concerns, please see [Report
a vulnerability]({{< relref "security#reporting-a-vulnerability" >}}).

## Vote for Feature Requests

Take a look at our tracked [Feature Requests]({{< relref "/feature-requests" >}}) and vote for those that you would love
to see with a thumbs up (üëç) reaction on GitHub.

## Community Support

We receive support requests. We are often able to resolve them in a timely manner. But you may be able to help resolve
them by communicating with the help-seeker.

The
[tickets are labeled with `support`](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asupport).
The [r/mumble/ subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mumble/new/) also regularly receive support requests.

## Development

We are always looking for helping hands willing to contribute to Mumble.

### Translation

Mumble is available in various languages.

You can help improve or update existing translations, translate new texts on existing languages, or introduce additional
languages.

We have a [Mumble project on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mumble/mumble-client/) where you can register
and start translating.

Weblate is a web translation platform. As a Website it is easy to access and use with any browser. For translators a
global and project memory of translations as well as machine translations can help in finding good translations.
Nevertheless, a native or good speaker is required to implement good translations.

The current status of our translations can be seen in the following graph:

[![Weblate translation status by language](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/mumble/-/mumble-client/horizontal-auto.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/mumble/)

### Testing

To find bugs and polish new releases we need testers.

If you want to test the newest development versions, you have two options:

- We provide development snapshots. You can download them from our [Downloads page]({{< relref "downloads#development-snapshots" >}}).
- Build the latest development version of Mumble, see [Building Mumble](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble#building).

If you find any issues, take a look at [Report Bugs](#report-bugs-and-feature-requests).

### Mumble Development

Mumble is mostly written in **C++** using the **Qt** library.  
Thus previous knowledge in C++ and Qt is definitely useful, but we also encourage interested people who want to learn it
to give it a try. We're happy to help you out, if needed.

The best way to get into Mumble development is to link up with us on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). Join
[`#mumble-dev:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#mumble-dev:matrix.org) or use the
[Direct Link via Element.io (Web App)](https://app.element.io/#/room/!VNUpYnUPdhTAqagvUu:matrix.org).

Alternatively you can create or comment on a pull request or issue report on GitHub.

#### Open issues and ongoing development

Also take a look at open [issues](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/pulls) on GitHub, especially with the following Labels:

- [Good first issue](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/labels/good%20first%20issue)

#### Tips

- To avoid unnecessary work and duplication, comment on issues and inform others what you plan to work on.
- You can also create
  [Draft Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests);
  this way you can work on the Pull Request, while others can see the progress and give you feedback.

### Additional projects

#### 3rd party Interfaces

Web interfaces, web-viewers, administration programs, CMS website modules ‚Äì all neat things we would love to see! These
could be written in any language supported by our Ice- or gRPC-based RPC Interfaces. You could start your own project or
link up with an {{< wiki "3rd Party Applications" "already existing one" />}}. To get an idea about how interaction with
the Mumble server might look like, you can take a look at the example scripts in our
[GitHub repository for mumble-scripts](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-scripts).

#### Ice authenticators

See {{< wiki Authenticators />}}. We‚Äôre happy for every authenticator and authenticator improvement.

#### Positional Audio plugins

Most of our [positional audio plugins](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Games#Positional_audio) regularly break on game
updates. To read on how you can help us update the plugins see the {{< wiki Pluginguide />}} page.

You can also add positional audio support to Games via our standard `Link` plugin. This way it will not get outdated,
but you need permission to change (and access to) the Source Code of a game (e.g. via an open license or developer
permission). See {{< wiki "Link" "Linking a game to Mumble" />}}.

#### Other 3rd party projects

If you are interested in more projects (Clients, Servers, cli tools etc.), you can also take a look at
{{< wiki "3rd Party Applications" />}}.

Many of these projects will either gladly accept help or can (often) be forked easily, because of the open licenses.

### Mumble Themes

You find the official Mumble theme in its own [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-theme).

Additional Mumble themes bring variety into Mumble's visual design and choices for different tastes.

You can find more information about themes in general and how to create themes on our
{{< wiki Themes "Themes wiki page" />}}.
