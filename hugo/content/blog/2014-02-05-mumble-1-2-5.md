The Mumble team has released version 1.2.5 of the Mumble VoIP application.

This new version contains two important client-side security fixes. We advise our users to download this update as soon
as possible from our SourceForge downloads page: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mumble/files/Mumble/1.2.5/>

This release contains no new features. For all practical purposes, it is a bug-fix release on top of 1.2.4.
