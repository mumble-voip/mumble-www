The Mumble team has [released version 1.2.14][1] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.14 is a bugfix release in
the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

<!--more-->

The actual source changes in 1.2.14 are small. This release removes a [commit][2] that caused crashing issues on exit
for some users of our overlay feature. This commit was backported from the 1.3.x (master) branch in order to fix a hang
issue some people are seeing with the overlay, but the change was not ready for prime time.

The previous release of Mumble, 1.2.13, transitioned to only signing Windows releases of Mumble with our SHA256
Authenticode certificate. As explained in the blog post for 1.2.13, we went from a scenario where we signed Mumble with
both a SHA1 signature and certificate, as well as a SHA256 signature and certificate. We did this because of
Microsoft&#8217;s SHA1 deprecation in code signing. This change has caused several issues for Windows Vista users, and
we&#8217;ve refined the process. The Mumble 1.2.14 release is now signed with a SHA1 signature and SHA256 certificate,
as well as a SHA256 signature and SHA256 certificate. This makes it easier for legacy versions of Windows to verify the
signature of Mumble.

For a full changelog, please see [the diff between 1.2.13 and 1.2.14 on GitHub][3].
