Quite some time has passed since our [last snapshot]({{< relref ""2021-05-16-mumble-1-4-0-snapshot6.md >}}) back in May of
this year. Since then we have worked hard to polish things up further and are therefore now able to present to you the first
_release candidate_ (RC) of Mumble 1.4.0.

You can download the new version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads#development-snapshots" >}}).
