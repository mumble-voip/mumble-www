Hello fellow Mumblers,

As you might have realised it has been quite some time since 1.2.2 was released and we are eager to take the next step:
1.2.3 stable.

Unfortunately there is one tricky thing about stable releases: They should be stable 🙂 With now more than [190.000
users][1] using 1.2.2 we cannot risk pushing something out there that breaks what used to work or behaves erratically in
other obvious ways. This is why we need **YOUR HELP**.

In our quest to exterminate each and every bug in Mumble, a quest at least as futile as honorable in software
development, we rely on bugreports from you. If you want a quick and stable 1.2.3 release, then get one of our snapshots
and test it. If you find a bug please visit our [bugtracker][2] and, unless there already is one, create a ticket.
Please remember that for us to be able to fix the bug we will need as much information on it as possible.

Thanks,

The Mumble Team
