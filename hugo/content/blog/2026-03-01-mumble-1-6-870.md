## Changes to the database backend

**Attention Server Administrators**:

With Mumble 1.6 we are switching to a new database backend, including a new database schema.
We include tested, automatic migration paths from your existing Mumble 1.5 database format to the
new one. But, we nonetheless encourage you to back up your database before upgrading to 1.6.

Please also be aware that our automatic migration will stop and immediately roll back to the old
database state as soon as any kind of error or ambiguous situation arises. This is to protect the
integrity of your existing 1.5 database. In those cases you will need to manually fix the offending rows
in your database before retrying the migration.

## Changes to command line arguments

**Attention Server Administrators**:

Please be aware that we have introduced a new CLI parsing library. To comply with the existing
standards, we have changed the syntax and wording of (almost) all of our CLI options for mumble-server.

That means you will have to update any auxiliary files that are used to start up your mumble-server such
as systemd services.

For example, ``-ini`` becomes ``--ini`` and ``-fg`` becomes ``--foreground``. For more information, see
the ``--help`` text of the binary or the man pages.

**Attention Power Users**:

The CLI options for the Mumble client have been changed, too. That means if you have created custom
shortcuts or startup scripts, you may need to change these to accommodate the new options.

We have also introduced a few new options, such as ``--hidden`` and ``--skip-settings-backup-prompt`` to
supply even more automation possibilities.
