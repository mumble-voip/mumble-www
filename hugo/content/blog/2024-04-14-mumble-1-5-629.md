We are happy to release the third and hopefully final release candidate of the new stable series Mumble 1.5.x. It fixes
some issues and finally introduces the long-awaited accessibility overhaul of the entire application.

Also, as requested by popular demand, we reintroduce RNNoise in the form of our own
[fork](https://github.com/mumble-voip/ReNameNoise). This should hopefully prevent any future issues while keeping a
beloved Mumble feature.

**Note**: If you want to use RNNoise and you are upgrading from the previous RC (1.5.613), you will need to manually
re-enable RNNoise in the settings.

You can download the new version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads#development-snapshots" >}}) (under
snapshots) or the [**GitHub release page**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/v1.5.629).
