We are pleased to announce the new stable series of Mumble 1.5.x. This series is started out by means of an initial
release candidate, that hopefully lets us verify that there are no major issues with this version before we perform the
actual stable release.

You can download the new version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads#development-snapshots" >}}) (under
snapshots) or the [**GitHub release page**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/v1.5.517).
