It has been a while since we published the previous release candidate of the new stable series of Mumble 1.5.x. But now, we are here to present to you the second release candidate which should hopefully pave the way for a swift 1.5.x stable release.

Since it has been so long, we have decided to allow some new features to be merged into this RC.

You can download the new version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads#development-snapshots" >}}) (under snapshots) or the
[**GitHub release page**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/v1.5.613).
