About two weeks have passed since our last release ([third
snapshot]({{< relref "/blog/2021-03-21-mumble-1-4-0-snapshot3" >}})). In that time we were able to fix a few bugs and work
on the overall polish a bit more, so that we can release the forth snapshot of 1.4.0 today.

After having understood what it means for a release to be a _snapshot release_ (see below), you can download the new
version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads#development-snapshots" >}}).

## Development Snapshots

A _development snapshot_ can be considered an open-beta for an upcoming feature release. This means that it contains the
latest and greatest features that were introduced since the last feature release. Note though that in contrast to a
_release candidate_ the list of features that will be included in the final 1.4.0 release is _not_ yet frozen and is
thus subject to change.

This does also mean that these features have not been tested by a broad audience yet and are therefore likely to still
contain bugs. These could be minor ones, but in theory these could also be major. Therefore it is important that you
always back up your data (e.g. configuration files) if you have a previous version of Mumble installed.

Due to the reasoning stated above, we do not recommend using snapshots in an environment where stability of the software
is key (e.g. in a business context).

That being said though, we strongly encourage you to try snapshots out if you are a tech-savvy person that can deal with
potentially arising problems and report any problems you encounter to our
[**issue tracker**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues). This kind of feedback is very important for us to be
able to make the actual release as stable and reliable as possible.
