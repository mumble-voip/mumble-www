We have been closely monitoring our bug trackers and crash reporting database and have come to the conclusion that it is
time to get Mumble 1.2.3 out there.

Since we had some minor code changes since the last RC we want to give the code a few more days to cool down and **we
plan to release Mumble 1.2.3 stable the upcoming weekend**.

We hope you&#8217;ll enjoy our new release. Snapshots/RC users will receive auto updates to stable. Mumble 1.2.2 stable
users will see the usual update notification. Of course there will also be another blog entry 😉

Regards,

The Mumble Team
