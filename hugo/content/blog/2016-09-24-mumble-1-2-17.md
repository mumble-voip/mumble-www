The Mumble team has [released version 1.2.17][1] of the Mumble VoIP application. Version 1.2.17 is a bugfix and security release in the stable 1.2-series of Mumble.

This version of Mumble updates our binary packages to use OpenSSL 1.0.2i (from 1.0.1t) due to the [OpenSSL Security Advisory 20160922][2]. Other dependencies have [also been updated][3].

Changes in this release:

  * For our binary packages, OpenSSL has been updated to 1.0.2i (from 1.0.1t) because of [OpenSSL Security Advisory 20160922][2]. The binary releases have been updated to use 1.0.2 rather than 1.0.1 because 1.0.1 will be end-of-life at the end of 2016.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the Mumble log view to be inacessible after receiving a specially crafted text message.
  * The PulseAudio backend will now fall back to default device if the chosen device is no longer present.
  * Mumble now explicitly sends plain text notifications to KDE and Freedesktop.org notification endpoints.
  * Xbox One controllers are now properly blacklisted from DirectInput on Windows 10 Anniversary Update.
  * Xbox button/controller names as shown by Mumble should now be correct for controllers other than the first controller. </ul>

For a full changelog, please see [the diff between 1.2.16 and 1.2.17 on GitHub][4].

We recommend that all users of our binary Mumble and Murmur (the server component of Mumble) packages upgrade as soon as possible.

You can download this release on [GitHub][5]. Enjoy!
