After quite some time, we are proud to present you with the first stable release of the Mumble 1.5.x series. While this
release may not be groundbreaking in terms of flashy and new features, we implemented a lot of quality-of-life and
structural improvements to provide a solid foundation for the future development of the project.

You can download the new version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads" >}}) or the [**GitHub release page**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/releases/tag/v1.5.634)
or from within your Windows client or software package management system.

# Mumble 1.5.634

Almost two years after the previous stable release Mumble 1.4.287, a lot of changes have been made to the codebase. With
this update, you will surely notice some long-standing bugs fixed, as well as some convenient changes that were long
overdue. In the time between the major versions, the project has exceeded the 10,000 commit mark and now has over 350
contributors. Thanks to all of you who contributed, translated, submitted issues, and tested pre-releases! Without you,
the Mumble project would not be possible at this scale â™¥

While the changelog is quite long, the amount of notable client changes is relatively small. For this release, we focus
on the few main changes. For the interested reader, we of course also include a full changelog at the bottom of this
page as well.

If you are wondering why this first 1.5.x release is not version 1.5.0, but 1.5.634, please see [this old blog
post describing our _new versioning scheme_]({{< relref "/blog/2021-12-07-new-versioning-scheme/index.md" >}}) that
explains the absence of the aforementioned version numbers.

## Feature spotlight

### Positional audio improvements

There have been some changes to the positional audio system, especially to better fine-tune the configuration. The
maximum distance thresholds have been significantly increased. The option to set a minimum volume of 0 has been brought
back. And some clever psychoacoustic effects, such as
[interaural delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaural_time_difference) as well as improved blooming will enhance
the positional audio experience even more.

For those users who wish to develop positional audio plugins - or try to debug them - we have added a convenient
"Positional Audio Viewer" to the developer context menu. This replaces the existing external "MumblePAHelper" with an
in-client solution. It shows you the positional information of your client and the associated metadata in real-time.

### UI and accessibility overhaul

Mumble 1.5 introduces some quality-of-life UI changes alongside the long-awaited accessibility overhaul. In the software
context, [accessibility features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility) (often abbreviated as "a11y")
are considerations and tools meant to reduce the hassle of running a specific application for users with disabilities.
Most often, you will find features specifically crafted or tweaked for visually impaired users, but other disabilities
such as cognitive or motor impairments should also be considered.

We ensured that the entire application is now keyboard navigable and removed any existing focus traps. We also
implemented forwarding of some context information, such as the muted/deafened state of other users, are now forwarded
to screen readers. Also, all existing settings pages, their contents, and any actions that were previously only
available as a toolbar button are now usable without a mouse. If you are using a screen reader or other accessibility
tooling and have any trouble using Mumble 1.5.634, make sure to let us know via our
[**GitHub issue tracker**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues). We want to make sure the application is usable
by everyone.

For users regulary connecting to very large Mumble servers, some neat features were added to make life easier: The new
message thresholding options will make Mumble suppress certain notifications when a configurable user limit is reached
on the server. Additionally, users are now able to not only hide certain channels explicitly when activating the channel
filter, but also pin channels in the filtered view even when they are empty.

The new inline local volume adjustment slider removes the complexity of using a dedicated popup menu and therefore
reduces the required clicks for the same action significantly.

A lot of new global shortcut actions were added, including many of the menubar options, allowing to control Mumble with
ease even when the window is minimized or a fullscreen application is running. Furthermore, the volume of notifications,
audio cues, and text-to-speech can now be changed separately.

There have also been quite a lot of UI fixes, such as the chat log scrolling up when a new image is posted, the "channel
name links" not behaving correctly in the chat log, hiding UI elements not being persistent, and more!

### Persistent channel listeners

Channel Listeners - a feature introduced in [Mumble 1.4]({{< relref "/blog/2022-01-16-mumble-1-4-230" >}}) - were previously
only valid for the current user session. In this release, we introduce persistent channel listeners for registered users.
That means existing listeners and their respective volume adjustments will be remembered by the server across reconnections.
