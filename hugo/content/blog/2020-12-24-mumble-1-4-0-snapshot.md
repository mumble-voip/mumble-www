This year we have a Christmas present for you: we are proud to announce that the first **snapshot release of Mumble
1.4.0** is released as of now. It is a very important step towards the actual release of version 1.4.0.

After having understood what it means for a release to be a _snapshot release_ (see below), you can download the new
version from our [**Downloads page**]({{< relref "/downloads#development-snapshots" >}}).

## Development Snapshots

A _development snapshot_ can be considered an open-beta for an upcoming feature release. This means that it contains the
latest and greatest features that were introduced since the last feature release. Note though that in contrast to a
_release candidate_ the list of features that will be included in the final 1.4.0 release is _not_ yet frozen and is
thus subject to change.

This does also mean that these features have not been tested by a broad audience yet and are therefore likely to still
contain bugs. These could be minor ones, but in theory these could also be major. Therefore it is important that you
always back up your data (e.g. configuration files) if you have a previous version of Mumble installed.

Due to the reasoning stated above, we do not recommend using snapshots in an environment where stability of the software
is key (e.g. in a business context).

That being said though, we strongly encourage you to try snapshots out if you are a tech-savvy person that can deal with
potentially arising problems and report any problems you encounter to our
[**issue tracker**](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues). This kind of feedback is very important for us to be
able to make the actual release as stable and reliable as possible.

## Feature spotlight

As there are many, many changes with this new version, here is a selection of things that we think are most prominent.
If you're interested in all changes, have a look at the full [changelog](#changelog).

### Channel listeners

This feature can to some extent be compared to the ability to link channels. Except that this does not operate on a
per-channel basis but on a per-user basis.

Concretely this new feature allows a user to "listen to" a channel. In that case all audio that is heard by people in
this particular channel (be it by direct communication, shouts or via linked channels) is also heard by the listening
user. Conceptually you could picture "listening to" a channel with placing a microphone in a room and then listening to
what is recorded.

This feature is one-way only meaning that in order to speak to people in the listened channel, you'll have to either
join the channel or shout to it.

It should be noted though that you will not be secretly listened to with this new feature. Listening to a channel
creates a new entry in the channel's user-list (referred to as an "ear" or a "listener") and is thereby just as visible
as a user actually being in that channel. There is also a dedicated ACL and several new server config options that can
restrict this new feature.

Older clients (< 1.4.0) will not indicate listeners in the UI though! They are informed if this feature is enabled on a
server when they join it though (via chat).

Note: This feature requires server-side support and is thus only available on servers at least running Mumble 1.4.0.

### TalkingUI

Have you ever been in a situation where you heard someone talking but couldn't quite figure out who it was? Then this
feature is probably for you!

The TalkingUI can be considered the equivalent of the already existing overlay but for non-gamers or in other terms "for
everyday usage".

This feature adds an optional floating window containing a list of currently speaking users and their respective
channels. This allows you to quickly see who's currently talking and in which channel that person currently is in (this
becomes important if you want to respond to that person).

The big difference between the TalkingUI and Mumble's main window (which of course also contains this information) is
that the TalkingUI does not contain all the other UI elements nor does it necessarily show the entire channel-tree.
Furthermore it automatically resizes itself to the minimal size needed to display the respective information. Thus it
usually does not take up a lot of space and can therefore be left floating in the corner of the screen without consuming
too much screen real estate.

Note that the TalkingUI is highly configurable (Settings -> User Interface) and also does provides selection and
context-menu support just as you get it in the main window. In fact the selection between TalkingUI and main window is
synchronized and thus this plays really nice with the new "whisper to selected" feature allowing to whisper to whatever
currently is selected in the UI (be it a channel or a user).

### UI indication for access restrictions

In previous versions of Mumble there was no indication of whether you are able to join a channel or not. You just had to
try it out and either it worked or you got a Permission Denied message. This feature solves this problem by marking
"access-restricted" channels with a lock icon. Access restricted channels are all channels that are either only open to
a specific group on the server or require a password (access token) to join.

In total a channel can be in one of three states: either it is not access-restricted in which case it just looks like
channels used to look prior to the introduction of this feature or it is indeed access-restricted. In the latter case a
lock icon is shown to the right of channel name. This look can either be open and green or closed and red. Green means
that you can enter the channel nonetheless (you belong to the required group or have the correct password (access token)
set) whereas red means that you are not allowed to enter the channel.

Note that this is also a feature that requires server-side support and thus only takes effect on servers that are at
least running Mumble version 1.4.0.

### Markdown

For those of you who don't know what markdown is, we recommend a quick read of the respective
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). In simple words it allows formatting of text by simply
typing a few extra characters in your text.

Mumble now supports markdown for text messages written in the normal chat bar. It is not supported for cases in which
you use the dedicated message editor. Furthermore only a subset of markdown is supported: sections, inline-code,
code-blocks, bold, italic and strike-through text, links and quotes. _Not_ supported are lists and tables.

This feature is probably best explained by an example. Try pasting the following text into the chat bar and see for
yourself:

````
# Markdown
## Code
We can have `inline` code and
```
code
    blocks
```

## Emphasis
**bold** and *italic* (__bold__ and _italic_ also works) text is supported. ~~Scratch that~~

## Links
We can have [links](google.de) and www.google.de

## Quotes
> I am a quote
Although these are not pretty, they do work and are supported.

## Escaping
We can escape special characters using the \\ character: \*not italic\* and \*\*not bold\*\*
````

### Stereo playback

With version 1.4.0 Mumble (finally) learned how to play back stereo audio streams. This means that it is now possible to
send a stereo stream to a Mumble client and it will actually be played back without being mixed down to a mono stream.

Note however that this feature is currently restricted to playback. The official Mumble client will still continue
sending audio as mono. This feature is primarily intended to be made use of by (music) bots.

If you want to try this feature out yourself, you can either write a bot using
[pymumble](https://github.com/azlux/pymumble) version 1.2 or later or you can simply use a recent version of
[botamusqiue](https://github.com/azlux/botamusique).

### Nicknames

For those of you who are annoyed by people using excessively long or complicated names or people changing their nickname
frequently, Mumble 1.4.0 introduces the possibility to set a nickname for every client.

Depending on your configuration, a nickname will either be displayed next to a user's name or replace it entirely.

The nickname will persist across restarts of client and server. In fact it'll last until you either remove it again or
the person the nickname was assigned to changes their client-certificate (Mumble's way of keeping track of a user's
identity).

Note that nicknames are _not_ tied to a particular server. That means that if you assign a nickname to a user on server
A and then you meet that person again on server B, they will still have that very same nickname set on server B.

## Special thanks

We want to thank everyone who spent time on the project. Without this kind of help from you, we would not be able to
provide the software the way it is.
